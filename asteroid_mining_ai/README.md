# Asteroid Mining AI Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI/machine learning system to assist in various aspects of asteroid mining, 
including identifying suitable asteroids, planning extraction processes, and optimizing resource utilization.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory to store raw and processed data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models.
- `reports/`: Directory for project documentation and reports.
- `visualizations/`: Directory for storing visualization outputs.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asteroid_mining_ai.git
    cd asteroid_mining_ai
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Example Workflow
1. Data collection and preprocessing.
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Jupyter notebooks.
3. Model development and training.
4. Model evaluation and validation.
5. Deployment of the AI system.
6. Documentation and presentation of results.

## Fetching Data from Asterank API

To fetch asteroid data from the Asterank API, run the following script:

```sh
python scripts/fetch_asterank_data.py
```

This will save the data to `data/asterank_data.csv`.

Then, you can preprocess this data by running:

```sh
python scripts/preprocess_data.py
```

Finally, train your model using the preprocessed data:

```sh
python scripts/train_model.py
```
